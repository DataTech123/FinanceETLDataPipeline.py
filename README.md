Introduction:
This retail analytics pipeline project primarily benefits finance and operational systems for detection of payments in sales revenue. 
Through this project can help to identify risks, losses, profits, and potentially fraudulent transactions originating from consumers.

Projecct purpose:
The central objective of the project is to automate ETL and ELT dataflows.
This is achieved by configuring job schedules that run on a daily basis,ensuring consistent and timely data processing.

Data explanation:
In a working environment where ETL is used routinely, I can coordinate with data engineering teams to automate data flow processes.
I can easily adapt to any cloud-based data warehouses and tools, including Snowflake, RedShift, AWS, and BigQuery,
which are accessible for processing data analysis. 

Thank you for your questions and feedback.
